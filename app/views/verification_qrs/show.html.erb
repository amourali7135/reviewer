Remember this is a user scanning a business QR to prove verification.  What if not registered?  L8R.
1:  Generate QR automatically via callback.  Done I think.
2:  And have it show here.  On it.
3:  Hit controller action for update.

4:  Update params to include user_Id
5:  Pundit access restricted for business owner only.


redirect_to controller: 'thing', action: 'edit', id: 3, something: 'else'

redirect_to new_user_path(:id => 1, :contact_id => 3, :name => 'suleman')
